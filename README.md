# Employee-Attrition-Prediction-and-Analysis

### Predicting Employee Turnover with Machine Learning

---

## 📋 Project Description
The **Proactive Attrition Risk System** is designed to address the ongoing challenge of employee attrition — the sudden and frequent loss of organizational talent. High turnover increases recruitment and training costs while reducing overall team morale and expertise.

This system leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Predictive Analytics** to help organizations **proactively identify high-risk employees** before they leave. By predicting which employees are most likely to resign, HR teams can apply targeted retention strategies and make data-driven workforce decisions.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
1. **Identify key causes** behind employee turnover.  
2. **Forecast the likelihood** of an employee leaving their job.  
3. **Enable proactive HR decisions** to prevent talent loss and reduce attrition costs.
